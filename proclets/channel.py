    Channels provide a service somewhat like an email client; they deliver
    Performative_ s to an inbox corresponding to the `uid`
    of the Proclet recipient.

    These messages can be retrieved one at a time, after the manner of a queue.
    There are also higher-level methods which allow Proclets to process messages in batches.

    By default, messages are only delivered once. However, each Proclet transition may
    independently access the channel; to do that, pass `this` to the `party` parameter
    of the channel method.
